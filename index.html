        <p class="intro">This is a story about the flight of a French immigrant to America in the late
          18th century and how it fits into the larger history of French ancestral origin stories in America. This story
          not only holds great significance to me as a descendant of Louis Chachere (1760-1827), but is one of countless
          immigration
          stories that make up the United States.
        </p>
        <p class="intro">While
          taking place over two-hundred years ago, the story of Louis
          Chachere is at its core no different than that of people seeking a new life in the United States free
          from
          religious and political persecution. His story provides a personal case study that can act as a gateway to
          tell the
          larger story of French roots in America, and specifically Southern Louisiana. </p>

        <!-- <p>The subject of our story, who’s journey will help guide us as an example of
          people of French origin laying down roots in Louisiana, was a man named
          Louis Chachere. Born around 1760 in France, not much is confirmed about
          Louis Chachere before he traveled to Louisiana, but much is speculated.
        </p> -->
        <p>It is important to note that Louis Chachere’s story, or rather the story of how
          he became Louis Chachere, has largely been documented through oral
          history in addition to a select few tangible records. Much of his journey to Louisiana, as well as his
          background in France, is hard to identify with complete certainty because he was covering his tracks while
          fleeing from
          Revolutionary France. Because of this, it is important to pair everything that is known about his story with
          the broader history of people leaving France for North
          America during this time. By doing this, it is possible to fill in the gaps and explain how people who
          undertook this journey layed down
          roots
          in Southern
          Louisiana.</p>

        <p>Louis's original surname was not <em>Chachere</em>, but most likely <em>de Charette</em>. Chachere is a made
          up name
          that he
          would later create in North America, which will be detailed later on in this story. Because of the implication
          that he was a noble, as well as his original
          surname being de Charette, Louis is speculated to be a part of the noble de Charette family. The de Charette
          family had close familial ties to the Bourbon line of French royalty, incuding King Louis XVI himself. Many
          of its members held leadership roles in attempting
          to defend the monarchy during the French Revolution.</p>

        <p>Not much can be accurately confirmed about his life in France, but as a likely member of French
          nobility rumored to have familial relations to the upper echelons of French
          society, it leaves little to the imagination as to why Louis would want to flee from France at the onset of a

        <p>Thought to be a cousin to Louis Chachere, Francois de Charette was a notable French General who served in
          the American Revolutionary War as well as was active as a counter revolutionary military leader. He assisted
          in defending Louis XVI during many attempts to kill or capture the royal family in 1792.He was later given
