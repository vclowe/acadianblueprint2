                    increased discussion surrounding the issue of immigration to the United States in recent
                    years, it is important to look further back into history and understand how the problems that past

                <p>As previously mentioned, Louis Chachere most likely fled from France because of the looming
                    revolution. This was the case for many French immigrants fleeing to North America at this time, but
                    it is still important
                    to understand how this fits into the broader history of French immigration to North America in the
                    18th century.</p>

                <p>French presence in Nova Scotia can be traced as far back as the early 17th
                    century after many unsuccessful attempts to settle in modern day New
                    England. French settlers eventually began to set up settlements throughout
                    modern day Nova Scotia due to the uncontested colonial nature of the area,
                    as well as their willingness to cooperate and build relationships with
                    indigenous peoples of the region. It became a very popular entry
                    point into North America for generations of French people looking to leave
                    France and find business opportunities and a new life.
                </p>
                <p>However prosperous Nova Scotia was for French settlers, it
                    also proved tumultuous and violent at times. This region was largely
                    independent from colonial France, and was mainly governed by its
                    inhabitants. Over time the British colonial forces began to seek control of
                    the region, spawning several violent expulsions of French
                    people starting in the mid 18th century. This was a major
                    contributing factor for many French settlers of Nova Scotia, commonly referred to as Acadians, to
                    flee to places like Louisiana.</p>

                <p>The usage of the word <em>Acadia</em> or <em>Acadians</em> can be traced to Greek origins
                    from the word <em>Arkadia</em>, meaning a place of refuge. The area known today as
                    Nova Scotia was commonly given the designation of <em>Acadia</em> or <em>Acadie</em> when
                    it began to be settled in the 17th century. This identity evolved over the next couple of centuries
                    and is
                    commonly applied to people who are descendants of French Settlers of Nova
                    Scotia as well as descendants of French people who settled elsewhere in
                    North America.

                <p>Most Americans today are familiar with a version of this word,

                    to making the undertaking of documenting the history of any Cajun family, very tricky. People

                <p>Regardless of British
                    colonial aggression in the region, Nova Scotia still remained a popular
                    stopping point for many people immigrating from France in the latter half of the 18th century.
                    Whether it was making their way
                    back after a lackluster repatriation into French society or escaping France
                    from the growing conflicts leading up to and during the French Revolution,
                    Nova Scotia became a gateway for French refugees, exiles, and immigrants.</p>
                <p>
                    From here it was very common for French travelers to make their way over
                    to the Mississippi River via the Great Lakes or American Midwest. This was the route that Louis
                    Chachere would have taken to Southern Louisiana.</p>
                <p>Many French people were repatriated back to France during this time from
                    Nova Scotia because of the British expulsion campaigns. A great deal of these
                    repatriated citizens couldn’t find their place in their home country, and
                    eventually decided to journey back to North America, taking a more
                    direct route accross the Atlantic Ocean seeking Southern Louisiana.</p>
                <p>Lastly, many travelers made stops in St. Domingue, now Haiti,
                    on their way to Southern Louisiana. Southern Louisiana and some
                    surrounding pockets would go on to be identified as Acadiana.</p>
